# AI Video Transcriber

In this project, we will perform a transcription from a YouTube video as an example of text extraction from a video, so that we can then ask questions to an LLM about it or create a list of bullet points. This methodology could easily be extended to transcription and summarization from Google Meet or Zoom meetings.

We'll use the video of Ray Kurzweil and Geoff Hinton Debate the Future of AI, [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCre83853TM)
