# AI Video Transcriber

In this project, we will perform a transcription from a YouTube video as an example of text extraction from a video, so that we can then ask questions to an LLM about it or create a list of bullet points. This methodology could easily be extended to transcription and summarization from Google Meet or Zoom meetings.
